						<h2>Strength</h2>
						<p>I think I have three great strengths, which are worth to point out.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
							My biggest strength is planning. I always plan things ahead and make tasks I need to accomplish well originated. For example, I would put events I want to attend into to calendar and assignments into both to-do list application and calendar (to-do list reminds me what I need to do, calendar reminds me when and how long should I work on them). Therefore, I can easily track my schedule and workload to make sure I can get everything done on time. Another trick I do to make sure I finish tasks in a reasonable time is thinking ahead how I am going to complete a task before I start to work on it. For example, I usually think about what I am going to write in an essay when I am running. This strength basically helps me to succeed in academic and working area.</li>
							<li>
								My second strength is great leadership. In a group, I usually play a role as idea generator, organizer, and quality inspector. I always can generate great new ideas either to improve existing projects or build brand new projects. I have clear timeline in mind when we implement a project. Since I read a lot and know lot of technology, so when implementing a project, I will suggest the most fitted technology to build the project. I always try to make the project as good as possible. I will ask supervisors to give feedbacks for the implantation and share the information with team members. If there is something going wrong, I will try to split the project into two approaches to reduce risks and take more responsibility to implement most challenging work.
							</li>
							<li>
								Another strength is sensibility. I am very sensible to others’ feeling and emotion, since I always put myself into their perspectives and positions. I am also very sensible to technology and design. I have the vision to see what technology and design people will like before it gets popular.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h2>Weakness</h2>
						<p>I also have three major weaknesses.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								I am easy to envy at others’ accomplishments. I consider myself have very strong capability, so when I see others get awarded, I feel it is not fair since I am not worse than them and I also need to get the awards. Actually, I do not think the weakness is very bad. It usually can prompt me to rethink myself to find out where I did not do well and work harder to improve myself.
							</li>
							<li>
								Sometimes, I am not very focusing. For example, when I know that I will have plenty of time to perform a task, I can be easily distracted from current tasks, such checking Facebook while reading a book. The weakness can make me work very inefficiently. However, I can be really focusing and productive when time is really tight.
							</li>
							<li>
								Another weakness is that I can be impatient when I have put lots of effort and time on one task, but it does not make significant progress. For example, when someone asks me a question and he/she still cannot understand it after I explain several times, I will lose my patience and let him/her to ask someone else.
							</li>

						<h2 class="">External Analysis</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="bl-content">
						<p>The comments from my family and friends are very interesting. Basically, everyone has different impression to me and some are completely opposite.</p>
						<h2>Strength</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Most people think I am an easy-going person. I always think by standing in someone else’s position and worry about causing trouble to others.
							</li>
							<li>
								Some people think I am very willing to help others. I always ask people if they need my help.
							</li>
							<li>
								Most people think I am very hard working and self-disciplined. I am assiduous in studying and put much more efforts and time on studying and working than others. As a result, I did very well in studying and working.
							</li>
							<li>
								Some think my computer skill is very high. I know a lot about computers and technology. I always help friends and family fix issues about computers and other electronic gadgets.
							</li>
							<li>
								Some think I can focus on what on what I love to do.
							</li>
							<li>
								Some think I am very creative and business-savvy. For example, once my old computer was broken, if selling it as a whole machine, the price was very low. As a result, I tore down the computer into different component and sold them at a much higher price.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Weakness</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Most of people think I am not very good at expressing my ideas and attitudes. I do not like to talk to the people, who I am not interesting in.
							</li>
							<li>
								Some people think I talk too much, and I can be annoying sometimes due to this weakness.
							</li>
							<li>
								Some think that I am bad at emotion control. I am easy to get too nervous at critical section, such as exams. For example, I used to be hard to get into sleep the day before the exam, so I cannot achieve my best performance in the exam.
